# Instructions

Thank you for your interest in joining MDST! We're super excited to get you started on the process for joining the club. New members are required to **complete two tutorials** giving an introduction to data science and programming in Python. The purpose of these tutorials is to make sure that all of our members, despite their background, is able to equally contribute to MDST projects.

<div class="callout font-normal">
    The tutorials for Fall 2023 are still under development. Check back in at a later time for links to these tutorials and in-depth instructions on how to complete them. To hear first when they are released, sign up for our mailing list via our [interest form](https://forms.gle/B5TyHZHL44BcoKNX6). We also recommend reading through our [FAQ](/join#FAQ) for any questions you may have in the meantime.

## Tutorial Format

The format of each tutorial includes:

- A [Jupyter notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) which walks you through the relevant content for that tutorial. Never heard of a Jupyter notebook before? Check out the [Jupyter documentation](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) to learn more. Follow [our setup guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17AOCdbztv6G0t5cha2_9buWi-MrCUS0vN20rbpKg-GI/edit?usp=sharing) to setup Jupyter locally.
- A **checkpoint** to check your understanding of the tutorial content. <u>You must correctly complete and submit this checkpoint in order to join MDST</u>.

<div class="callout">
    In addition to the main 2 tutorials, there is an **_optional_ challenge** component which you can complete to showcase your skills in more advanced data science concepts such as machine learning. Your performance on these challenge sections will be used to determine your placement into more difficult projects.

## Submission and Evaluation

When you sign up for projects at the beginning of each semester, you will be asked to submit a link to the GitHub repository containing all the completed checkpoints plus the optional challenges (if attempted). If you've never worked with Git and GitHub before, check out our [Git Version Control Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pq42R2xr_yoyhyzWE0ugReHgEKgwLdjrJR4mT3_CQEo/edit?usp=sharing).

- <u>If your checkpoints are incomplete, then you will not be allowed to join MDST for that semester.</u> In such circumstance, you may attempt the checkpoints again the next semester and resubmit.
- Our education committee will evaluate your submission for your strength with Python programming and data science library usage. New members with greater skills in these areas are more likely to be placed into tougher projects.

## Office Hours and Getting Help

If you feel frustrated at any point when working through the tutorials, know it is normal (the majority of active MDST members have been in your exact spot before and know how annoying working with some of this technology could be). For this reason, our education committee hosts **office hours** throughout the onboarding process so you can ask questions and get help on what you're stuck on. **See our [events calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_22ca0c151585760442cad5796fb91bd18b7db11d813e9143e38549aadce65afe%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York) for office hour times and locations.**

In addition, feel free to email us at [mdst-coms@umich.edu](mailto:mdst-coms@umich.edu) with any questions or issues you might have while working on tutorials.
