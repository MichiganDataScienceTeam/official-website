## FAQ

### Are there any requirements to join?

**No!** We welcome all University of Michigan students, regardless of academic level or major.

### I have no data science experience. Can I join?

**Yes!** Everyone is welcome to join the team! In fact, most of our members have very little data science experience prior to joining. Our goal is to help you learn the data skills necessary to contribute to our projects and perform data science on your own. We do strongly recommend newcomers attend our introductory tutorials, as they will teach you the basics of the tools we use and are also a great opportunity to meet others in the same boat!

### During onboarding, are the new member mass meeting/tutorial/office hours mandatory?

No, they are not.

### When is the regular meeting time of MDST?

We meet on all Sundays (except for holidays) from 12-3 for a mandatory work session. You are permitted to miss a few of these but we unfortunately cannot accept you if you have a hard conflict.

We also meet on Thursdays from 6-7 for optional social and professional events such as guest speakers and networking sessions.

### Will I be able to choose which project team I am on?

Yes! After you join the club, you will be asked to rank your top 5 projects after talking with project leaders. Historically, 90+% of people are placed into one of their top two preferences.

### How much time commitment do you require?

Most MDST members spend 3 hours weekly for work sessions + 1 hour for socials on Thursday, totaling about 4 hours per week. This may vary based on the project and level of familiarity with data science.

### Does MDST allow for remote participation?

MDST is primarily an in-person club, and all of our events and work sessions are held in-person on campus. We allow remote participation for our projects, but not for our other events. We recommend attending our meetings in-person whenever possible to maximize your experience with the club.

### What languages do you use?

We primarily use **Python** for our projects. If you are an R user, we recommend checking out some helpful tutorials from [DataCamp](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datacamp.com%2Fcourses%2Fpython-for-r-users&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0EGZ-9JrV1X0Kls2TJ_r7j).

### I am not a student at the University of Michigan. Can I join?

**No.** We only accept Umich students.
