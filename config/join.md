# FAQ

## Are there any requirements to join?

**No!** We welcome all University of Michigan students, regardless of academic level or major.

## How do I join?

MDST takes new members at the beginning of each Fall/Winter semester. New members are required to complete a set of 2 tutorials giving an introduction to data science and programming in Python. While attendance at the tutorials is not mandatory, each tutorial will have an associated checkpoint which you must correctly complete and submit in order to join.

Additionally, these tutorials have an _optional_ challenge component which you can complete to share your skills in advanced data science concepts such as machine learning. Your performance on these challenge sections will be used to determine if you will be placed into more difficult projects.

## I have no data science experience. Can I join?

**Yes!** Everyone is welcome to join the team! Most of our members have very little data science experience prior to joining, and our goal is to help you learn the necessary skills to be a data scientists. We do strongly recommend newcomers attend our introductory tutorials, as they will teach you the basics of the tools we use and are also a great opportunity to meet others in the same boat!

## How much time commitment do you require?

Most MDST members spend 3 hours weekly for work sessions + 1 hour for socials on Thursday, totaling about 4 hours per week.

## Does MDST allow for remote participation?

MDST is a in-person club primarily, as all of our events and work sessions are held in-person on campus. We do allow remote participation for our projects, but we do not offer remote participation for our other events. We recommend attending our meetings in-person whenever possible to maximize your experience with the club.

## What languages do you use?

We primarily use **Python**, but we sometimes work with other programming languages based on needs of specific projects. If you are an R user, we recommend checking out [this](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datacamp.com%2Fcourses%2Fpython-for-r-users&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0EGZ-9JrV1X0Kls2TJ_r7j) helpful tutorial on DataCamp.

## I am not a student at the University of Michigan. Can I join?
