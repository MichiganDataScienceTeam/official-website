New members must complete a series of tutorials teaching fundamental Python programming and data science skills, introducing the fundamental skills needed to participate in our projects.

Check back in at the beginning of the Fall 2023 semester for more information on completing tutorials. In the meantime, sign up to hear from us via our [interest form](https://forms.gle/B5TyHZHL44BcoKNX6), and read through our [FAQ](/join#FAQ).

# FAQ

## Are there any requirements to join?

**No!** We welcome all University of Michigan students, regardless of academic level or major.

## How do I join?

MDST takes new members at the beginning of each Fall/Winter semester. New members are required to complete 2 tutorials giving an introduction to data science and programming in Python. While attendance is not mandatory, each tutorial will have an associated checkpoint which you must correctly complete and submit in order to join.

Additionally, these tutorials include an _optional_ challenge component which you can complete to showcase your skills in advanced data science concepts such as machine learning. Your performance on these challenge sections will be used to determine your placement into more difficult projects.

## I have no data science experience. Can I join?

**Yes!** Everyone is welcome to join the team! In fact, most of our members have very little data science experience prior to joining. Our goal is to help you learn the data skills necessary to contribute to our projects and perform data science on your own. We do strongly recommend newcomers attend our introductory tutorials, as they will teach you the basics of the tools we use and are also a great opportunity to meet others in the same boat!

## How much time commitment do you require?

Most MDST members spend 3 hours weekly for work sessions + 1 hour for socials on Thursday, totaling about 4 hours per week. This may vary based on the project and level of familiarity with data science.

## Does MDST allow for remote participation?

MDST is primarily an in-person club, and all of our events and work sessions are held in-person on campus. We allow remote participation for our projects, but not for our other events. We recommend attending our meetings in-person whenever possible to maximize your experience with the club.

## What languages do you use?

We primarily use **Python** for our projects. If you are an R user, we recommend checking out [this](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datacamp.com%2Fcourses%2Fpython-for-r-users&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0EGZ-9JrV1X0Kls2TJ_r7j) helpful tutorial on DataCamp.

## I am not a student at the University of Michigan. Can I join?

**No.** Unfortunately, we are not currently accepting students outside U of M.
