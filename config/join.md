### Step 2 (Optional): Attend our Mass Meetings

MDST will host **one mass meeting** on January 18th, 2024 from 6:00-7:00pm at CCCB 0420 (tentatively). At these meetings, we will discuss details about our club, what we do, and how to join. You'll also have the opportunity to ask questions you may have about joining.
- Mass Meetings are for informational purposes. **We do not take attendance, and they are not part of the application process.**
- We will record our mass meeting and post the recording and presentation to this page after completion

### Step 3: Complete Tutorial Checkpoints

New members are required to **complete two tutorials** giving an introduction to data science and programming in Python. The purpose of these tutorials is to make sure that all of our members, despite their background, are able to equally contribute to MDST projects.

<div className="callout font-normal">
    The tutorials for Winter 2024 are now published in the tutorial GitHub [repository](https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/2023-Tutorials). The repository contains all the materials and instructions you need to complete the tuturials, as well as information about the support we provide if you have any questions.

<span className="highlight">Note: </span> Please direct all technical and logistical questions regarding tutorials to our <a href="https://edstem.org/us/join/6PXxzF">forum</a> for better visibility.

### Step 4: Submit Tutorials

As a final step to join the club, you must submit your tutorials certifying that you've completed the fundamental requirements to join the club. 

Closer to the submission date, we will post a Google Form where you can submit a link to the GitHub repository containing all the completed checkpoints plus the optional challenges (if attempted). See our [Tutorials Repo](https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/2023-Tutorials) for information on completing the tutorials. If you've never worked with Git and GitHub before, check out our [Git Version Control Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pq42R2xr_yoyhyzWE0ugReHgEKgwLdjrJR4mT3_CQEo/edit?usp=sharing).

- <span className="highlight">If your checkpoints are incomplete, then you will not be allowed to join MDST for that semester.</span> In such circumstance, you may attempt the checkpoints again the next semester and resubmit.


The project signup form will be due **February 1st, 11:59 PM**, after which we will no longer accept sign-ups to join MDST for the Winter 2024 semester.
