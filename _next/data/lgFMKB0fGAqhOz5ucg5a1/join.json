{"pageProps":{"join_info":"## Instructions\n\nThank you for your interest in joining MDST! We're super excited to get you started on the process for joining the club.\n\n### Step 1: Sign up for our mailing list\n\nOur mailing list is going to be the fastest way for us to reach you with the latest information on how to join, mass meetings, and other onboarding events. Fill out the [interest form](https://forms.gle/MYYA8pqXLMuqb93F7)) linked below to be added to our mailing list.\n\n<p className=\"md-button-wrapper\"><a className=\"md-button\" href=\"https://forms.gle/MYYA8pqXLMuqb93F7\"> Interest Form</a></p>\n\n<a href=\"#top\" class=\"scroll-up-button\"></a>\n\n<hr>\n\n### Step 2 (Optional): Attend our Mass Meetings\n<!--- Still need place for mass meetings --->\nMDST is hosting two mass meetings this year. Join us on September 2nd, 2024 or September 3rd, 2024 from 6:30 PM to 7:30 PM. At these meetings, we will discuss details about our club, what we do, and how to join. You'll also have the opportunity to ask questions you may have about joining.\n\nTake a look at our slides and recording from last semester's mass meeting:\n\n<p className=\"md-button-wrapper\"><a className=\"md-button\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KwbCaDidWKUAwzVfWL0gRVclE0ImLhjs05ypdxxqTa0/edit?usp=sharing\"> Mass Meeting Slides</a></p>\n<p className=\"md-button-wrapper\"><a className=\"md-button\" href=\"https://umich.zoom.us/rec/share/wVLHCDtudkjscVB3y8L2P6CFIwwOu6vyrwYd6YbATAvgEIrc6p1BWwBTLMbKZ9Uj.DjCG-vsr6OsiL-zA\"> Mass Meeting Recording</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n### Step 3: Complete Tutorial Checkpoints\n\nNew members are required to **complete two checkpoints** giving an introduction to data science and programming in Python. The purpose of these tutorials is to make sure that all of our members, despite their background, are able to equally contribute to MDST projects.\n\n<div className=\"callout font-normal\">\n    The tutorials for Fall 2024 are now published in the tutorial GitHub [repository](https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/MDST-Onboarding). The repository contains all the materials and instructions you need to complete the tutorials, as well as information about the support we provide if you have any questions.\n</div>\n\n<span className=\"highlight\">Note: </span> Please direct all technical and logistical questions regarding tutorials to our <a href=\"https://edstem.org/us/join/jxVrDG\">forum</a> for better visibility.\n\n<hr>\n\n### Step 4: Submit Tutorials\n<!--- Do we have a new project submission link for FA 2024? --->\nAs a final step to join the club, you must submit your checkpoints certifying that you've completed the fundamental requirements to join the club. \n\nSee our [Tutorials Repo](https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/MDST-Onboarding) for information on completing and submiting the tutorials. \n- <span className=\"highlight\">If your checkpoints are incomplete, then you will not be allowed to join MDST for that semester.</span> In such circumstance, you may attempt the checkpoints again the next semester and resubmit.\n\n\nThe submission form will be due **September 16th, 11:59 PM**, after which we will no longer accept sign-ups to join MDST for the Fall 2024 semester. \n\n<hr>\n\n### Step 5: Attend the Project Exploration Fair\n<!--- Need to add time and place --->\nAfter joining the club, we will host a project exploration fair on **September 8th, 2024** to share the projects which we will run this semester. You can speak with our project leads and learn first-hand about the type of work being done in each project, what the prerequistes are, and if the project is a good fit for you.\n\nAfter attending, you will be given access to a form to specify your top 3 project choices, from which we will place you into your preferred project (subject to constraints and appropriate difficulty).\n\n<div className=\"callout font-normal\">\n    ⚠️ You **must attend** the exploration fair to be placed on a project this semester. If you are unable to attend but would still like to participate in projects, you must [email us](mailto:mdst-coms@umich.edu) in advance letting us know, and we will consider your request on a case-by-case basis. If emailing us, please include `[EXPLORATION FAIR]` in your email title.\n</div>\n","faq":"## FAQ\n\n### Are there any requirements to join?\n\n**No!** We welcome all University of Michigan students, regardless of academic level or major.\n\n### I have no data science experience. Can I join?\n\n**Yes!** Everyone is welcome to join the team! In fact, most of our members have very little data science experience prior to joining. Our goal is to help you learn the data skills necessary to contribute to our projects and perform data science on your own. We do strongly recommend newcomers attend our introductory tutorials, as they will teach you the basics of the tools we use and are also a great opportunity to meet others in the same boat!\n\n### During onboarding, are the new member mass meeting/live tutorial/office hours mandatory?\n\nNo, they are not.\n\n### When is the regular meeting time of MDST?\n\nWe meet on all Sundays (except for holidays) from 12-3 for a mandatory work session. You are permitted to miss a few of these but we unfortunately cannot accept you if you have a hard conflict.\n\nWe also meet on Thursdays from 6-7 for optional social and professional events such as guest speakers and networking sessions.\n\nFor a detailed schedule, please see our [events calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_22ca0c151585760442cad5796fb91bd18b7db11d813e9143e38549aadce65afe%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York).\n\n### Will I be able to choose which project team I am on?\n\nYes! After you join the club, you will be asked to rank your top 5 projects after talking with project leaders. Historically, 90+% of people are placed into one of their top two preferences.\n\n### How much time commitment do you require?\n\nMost MDST members spend 3 hours weekly for work sessions + 1 hour for socials on Thursday, totaling about 4 hours per week. This may vary based on the project and level of familiarity with data science.\n\n### Does MDST allow for remote participation?\n\nMDST is primarily an in-person club, and all of our events and work sessions are held in-person on campus. We allow remote participation for our projects, but not for our other events. We recommend attending our meetings in-person whenever possible to maximize your experience with the club.\n\n### What languages do you use?\n\nWe primarily use **Python** for our projects. If you are an R user, we recommend checking out some helpful tutorials from [DataCamp](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datacamp.com%2Fcourses%2Fpython-for-r-users&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0EGZ-9JrV1X0Kls2TJ_r7j).\n\n### I am not a student at the University of Michigan. Can I join?\n\n**No.** We only accept Umich students.\n","timeline":{"show_on_homepage":true,"title":"Recruiting Timeline Fall 2024","events":[{"title":"Mass Meeting 1 @ Michigan Union - Kuenzel Room","time":"September 2nd 6:00-7:00pm","description":"Join us to learn more about MDST and how to become a member."},{"title":"Mass Meeting 2 @ Michigan League - Henderson Room","time":"September 3rd 8:00-9:00pm","description":"Join us to learn more about MDST and how to become a member."},{"title":"Live Tutorial @ 3437 MH","time":"September 4th 7pm - 9pm","description":"Introduction to the Command Line, Python, and Pandas."},{"title":"Project Exploration Fair @ CCCB 2460","time":"September 8th","description":"Meet with project leads and get to know the project offerings for this semester."},{"title":"Office Hours 1 @ 2330 MH","time":"September 11th 7:00pm - 9:00pm","description":"Troubleshooting session for setup, tutorials, and checkpoints."},{"title":"Office Hours 2 @ G168 AH","time":"September 14th 2:00pm - 4:00pm","description":"Troubleshooting session for setup, tutorials, and checkpoints."},{"title":"Tutorial Submission Due","time":"September 16th 11:59pm","description":"Submit your completed tutorial materials for acceptance into the club."},{"title":"Project Work Session @ CCCB 3420 and CCCB 2460","time":"September 22nd 12:15pm - 3pm","description":"Start working on data science projects!"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
