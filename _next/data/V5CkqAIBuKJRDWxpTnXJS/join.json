Can I join?\n\n**Yes!** Everyone is welcome to join the team! In fact, most of our members have very little data science experience prior to joining. Our goal is to help you learn the data skills necessary to contribute to our projects and perform data science on your own. We do strongly recommend newcomers attend our introductory tutorials, as they will teach you the basics of the tools we use and are also a great opportunity to meet others in the same boat!\n\n### How much time commitment do you require?\n\nMost MDST members spend 3 hours weekly for work sessions + 1 hour for socials on Thursday, totaling about 4 hours per week. This may vary based on the project and level of familiarity with data science.\n\n### Does MDST allow for remote participation?\n\nMDST is primarily an in-person club, and all of our events and work sessions are held in-person on campus. We allow remote participation for our projects, but not for our other events. We recommend attending our meetings in-person whenever possible to maximize your experience with the club.\n\n### What languages do you use?\n\nWe primarily use **Python** for our projects. If you are an R user, we recommend checking out some helpful tutorials from [DataCamp](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datacamp.com%2Fcourses%2Fpython-for-r-users&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0EGZ-9JrV1X0Kls2TJ_r7j).\n\n### I am not a student at the University of Michigan. Can I join?\n\n**No.** We only accept Umich students.\n","timeline":{"show_on_homepage":false,"title":"Recruiting Timeline Fall 2023 (OLD)","events":[{"title":"Festifall Central @ Booth D79","time":"August 30th 2:30pm - 5pm","description":"Stop by our booth to meet the E-Board and learn about MDST."},{"title":"Mass Meeting 1 @ EH 1360","time":"August 31th 6:30pm - 7:30pm","description":"Join us to hear more about MDST and how to become a member.
