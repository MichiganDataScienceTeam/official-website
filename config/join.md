### Step 2 (Optional): Attend our Mass Meetings

MDST hosted **one mass meeting** on January 18th, 2024 from 6:00-7:00pm at CCCB 0420. At these meetings, we will discuss details about our club, what we do, and how to join. You'll also have the opportunity to ask questions you may have about joining.

### Step 3: Complete Tutorial Checkpoints

New members are required to **complete two tutorials** giving an introduction to data science and programming in Python. The purpose of these tutorials is to make sure that all of our members, despite their background, are able to equally contribute to MDST projects.

<div className="callout font-normal">
    The tutorials for Winter 2024 are now published in the tutorial GitHub [repository](https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/2023-Tutorials). The repository contains all the materials and instructions you need to complete the tutorials, as well as information about the support we provide if you have any questions.

<span className="highlight">Note: </span> Please direct all technical and logistical questions regarding tutorials to our <a href="https://edstem.org/us/join/6PXxzF">forum</a> for better visibility.
