{"pageProps":{"join_info":"## Instructions\n\nThank you for your interest in joining MDST! We're super excited to get you started on the process for joining the club.\n\n### Step 1: Sign up for our mailing list\n\nOur mailing list is going to be the fastest way for us to reach you with the latest information on how to join, mass meetings, and other onboarding events. Fill out the [interest form](https://forms.gle/pcpfjMwrXobyvn9N9) linked below to be added to our mailing list.\n\n<p className=\"md-button-wrapper\"><a className=\"md-button\" href=\"https://forms.gle/pcpfjMwrXobyvn9N9\"> Interest Form</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n### Step 2 (Optional): Attend our Mass Meetings\n\nMDST will host **one mass meeting** on January 18th, 2024 from 6:00-7:00pm at CCCB 0420 (tentatively). At these meetings, we will discuss details about our club, what we do, and how to join. You'll also have the opportunity to ask questions you may have about joining.\n- Mass Meetings are for informational purposes. **We do not take attendance, and they are not part of the application process.**\n- We will record our mass meeting and post the recording and presentation to this page after completion\n\n<hr>\n\n### Step 3: Complete Tutorial Checkpoints\n\nNew members are required to **complete two tutorials** giving an introduction to data science and programming in Python. The purpose of these tutorials is to make sure that all of our members, despite their background, are able to equally contribute to MDST projects.\n\n<div className=\"callout font-normal\">\n    The tutorials for Winter 2024 are now published in the tutorial GitHub [repository](https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/2023-Tutorials). The repository contains all the materials and instructions you need to complete the tuturials, as well as information about the support we provide if you have any questions.\n</div>\n\n<span className=\"highlight\">Note: </span> Please direct all technical and logistical questions regarding tutorials to our <a href=\"https://edstem.org/us/join/6PXxzF\">forum</a> for better visibility.\n\n<hr>\n\n### Step 4: Submit Tutorials\n\nAs a final step to join the club, you must submit your tutorials certifying that you've completed the fundamental requirements to join the club. \n\nCloser to the submission date, we will post a Google Form where you can submit a link to the GitHub repository containing all the completed checkpoints plus the optional challenges (if attempted). See our [Tutorials Repo](https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/2023-Tutorials) for information on completing the tutorials. If you've never worked with Git and GitHub before, check out our [Git Version Control Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pq42R2xr_yoyhyzWE0ugReHgEKgwLdjrJR4mT3_CQEo/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n- <span className=\"highlight\">If your checkpoints are incomplete, then you will not be allowed to join MDST for that semester.</span> In such circumstance, you may attempt the checkpoints again the next semester and resubmit.\n\n\nThe project signup form will be due **February 1st, 11:59 PM**, after which we will no longer accept sign-ups to join MDST for the Winter 2024 semester. \n","faq":"## FAQ\n\n### Are there any requirements to join?\n\n**No!** We welcome all University of Michigan students, regardless of academic level or major.\n\n### I have no data science experience. Can I join?\n\n**Yes!** Everyone is welcome to join the team! In fact, most of our members have very little data science experience prior to joining. Our goal is to help you learn the data skills necessary to contribute to our projects and perform data science on your own. We do strongly recommend newcomers attend our introductory tutorials, as they will teach you the basics of the tools we use and are also a great opportunity to meet others in the same boat!\n\n### During onboarding, are the new member mass meeting/tutorial/office hours mandatory?\n\nNo, they are not.\n\n### When is the regular meeting time of MDST?\n\nWe meet on all Sundays (except for holidays) from 12-3 for a mandatory work session. You are permitted to miss a few of these but we unfortunately cannot accept you if you have a hard conflict.\n\nWe also meet on Thursdays from 6-7 for optional social and professional events such as guest speakers and networking sessions.\n\nFor a detailed schedule, please see our [events calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_22ca0c151585760442cad5796fb91bd18b7db11d813e9143e38549aadce65afe%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York).\n\n### Will I be able to choose which project team I am on?\n\nYes! After you join the club, you will be asked to rank your top 5 projects after talking with project leaders. Historically, 90+% of people are placed into one of their top two preferences.\n\n### How much time commitment do you require?\n\nMost MDST members spend 3 hours weekly for work sessions + 1 hour for socials on Thursday, totaling about 4 hours per week. This may vary based on the project and level of familiarity with data science.\n\n### Does MDST allow for remote participation?\n\nMDST is primarily an in-person club, and all of our events and work sessions are held in-person on campus. We allow remote participation for our projects, but not for our other events. We recommend attending our meetings in-person whenever possible to maximize your experience with the club.\n\n### What languages do you use?\n\nWe primarily use **Python** for our projects. If you are an R user, we recommend checking out some helpful tutorials from [DataCamp](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datacamp.com%2Fcourses%2Fpython-for-r-users&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0EGZ-9JrV1X0Kls2TJ_r7j).\n\n### I am not a student at the University of Michigan. Can I join?\n\n**No.** We only accept Umich students.\n","timeline":{"show_on_homepage":true,"title":"Recruiting Timeline Winter 2024","events":[{"title":"Office Hours 1 @ UGLI Third Floor","time":"January 16th 7:00pm - 9:00pm","description":"Troubleshooting session for setup, tutorials, and checkpoints."},{"title":"Mass Meeting @ CCCB 0420 (Tentatively)","time":"January 18th 6:00-7:00pm","description":"Join us to learn more about MDST and how to become a member."},{"title":"Tutorial 1 @ Fishbowl Classroom","time":"January 21st 12pm - 3pm","description":"Introduction to the command line and Python."},{"title":"Office Hours 2 @ UGLI Third Floor","time":"January 23rd 7:00pm - 9:00pm","description":"Troubleshooting session for setup, tutorials, and checkpoints."},{"title":"Tutorial 2 @ Fishbowl Classroom","time":"January 28th 12pm - 3pm","description":"Build basic data science knowledge for project participation."},{"title":"Office Hours 3 @ UGLI Third Floor","time":"January 30th 7:00pm - 9:00pm","description":"Troubleshooting session for setup, tutorials, and checkpoints."},{"title":"Tutorial Submission Due","time":"Febiary 1st 11:59pm","description":"Submit your completed tutorial materials for acceptance into the club."},{"title":"Project Selection","time":"Febuary 4th TBD","description":"Meet with project leads and get to know the project offering."},{"title":"Project Signup Due","time":"Febuary 8th 11:59pm","description":"Indicate your project preferences."},{"title":"First Project Work Session @ TBD","time":"Febuary 11th 12:15pm - 3pm","description":"Start working on your projects!"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
