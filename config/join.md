### Step 3: Complete Tutorial Checkpoints

New members are required to **complete two tutorials** giving an introduction to data science and programming in Python. The purpose of these tutorials is to make sure that all of our members, despite their background, are able to equally contribute to MDST projects.

<div className="callout font-normal">
    The tutorials for Winter 2024 are now published in the tutorial GitHub [repository](https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/2023-Tutorials). The repository contains all the materials and instructions you need to complete the tutorials, as well as information about the support we provide if you have any questions.
</div>

<span className="highlight">Note: </span> Please direct all technical and logistical questions regarding tutorials to our <a href="https://edstem.org/us/join/jxVrDG">forum</a> for better visibility.

### Step 4: Submit Tutorials

As a final step to join the club, you must submit your tutorials certifying that you've completed the fundamental requirements to join the club.

<div className="callout font-normal">

</div>

See our [Tutorials Repo](https://github.com/MichiganDataScienceTeam/2023-Tutorials) for information on completing the tutorials.

### Step 5: Attend the Project Exploration Fair

After joining the club, we will host a project exploration fair on **February 4th, 2024 12-3pm** in **CCCB 2460** to share the projects which we will run this semester. You can speak with our project leads and learn first-hand about the type of work being done in each project, what the prerequistes are, and if the project is a good fit for you.

After attending, you will be given access to a form to specify your top 3 project choices, from which we will place you into your preferred project (subject to constraints and appropriate difficulty).

<div className="callout font-normal">
    ⚠️ You **must attend** the exploration fair to be placed on a project this semester. If you are unable to attend but would still like to participate in projects, you must [email us](mailto:mdst-coms@umich.edu) in advance letting us know, and we will consider your request on a case-by-case basis. If emailing us, please include `[EXPLORATION FAIR]` in your email title.
